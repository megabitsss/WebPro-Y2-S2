        <p>Guitar shops are businesses first and foremost, but they also serve as community hubs for music lovers. From a shop’s point of view, encouraging customers to play the instruments is crucial. It helps potential buyers gauge the feel, sound, and overall quality of the guitar.
        Playing the guitar is often the final step before making a purchase. A customer who spends time with an instrument is more likely to buy it. Therefore, shops generally welcome and even expect customers to try out guitars.
        However, allowing customers to handle guitars isn’t without its risks. Instruments can be damaged, and other customers may find excessive noise disruptive. Thus, while shops encourage playing, they also hope customers will follow some basic rules.
