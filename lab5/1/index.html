    <h1>Top 10 Programming Lanuguages For 2026</h1>
    <p class="top-desc">A programming language is a set of instructions, written in a specific syntax, that tells a computer what tasks to perform and how to perform them. By mastering a programming language, you can create software applications, websites, and other digital tools.</p>

            <h2>Python</h2>
            <p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.[34] Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.<p>

            <h2>Java</h2>
            <p>Java is a high-level, general-purpose, memory-safe, object-oriented programming language. It is intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.<p>

            <h2>C++</h2>
            <p>C++[b] is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup. First released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language, adding object-oriented (OOP) features, it has since expanded significantly over time adding more OOP and other features.<p>
